Scheduled Maintenance The services shall be subject to a regularly scheduled weekly maintenance window. Iterate makes commercially reasonable efforts to establish maintenance windows during times that minimize impact to Customer’s users.

Iterate’s service level objective is 99.95% Availability measured on a monthly basis. Exhibit A > Interplay Platform Agreement Order Form > Service Level Description > 5. Availability A. Availability for the Subscription Services is measured monthly as a percentage of Scheduled Available Minutes. • \"Scheduled Available Minutes” are the total minutes in a month less the number of Scheduled Maintenance minutes in the applicable month. • \"Available Minutes\" is the number of Scheduled Available Minutes in a month less the aggregate number of minutes the Subscription Services were unavailable outside of Scheduled Maintenance. • \"Availability\" is a percentage calculated as the Available Minutes in a month divided by the Scheduled Available Minutes in the month. Exhibit A > Interplay Platform Agreement Order Form > Service Level Description > 5. Availability For example, in a 30 day month with 4 weekly Scheduled Maintenance windows of 8 hours, there are 41,280 Scheduled Available Minutes ((60 min. x 24 hrs. x 30 days)-(60 min. x 8 hrs. x 4 weeks) = 41,280). If the Subscription Services experienced an outage of two hours outside of Schedule Maintenance, there were 41,160 Available Minutes in the month (41,280 Scheduled Available Minutes – 120 minutes of unavailability). The resulting Availability percentage is 41,160 / 41,280 = 99.7%. Exhibit A > Interplay Platform Agreement Order Form > Service Level Description > 5. Availability B.
